Hereâ€™s a general workflow to run any of the projects in this repo:

1. **Clone this repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Aalphakeem-Adroit/Alx_DjangoLearnLab.git
   cd Alx_DjangoLearnLab
````

2. **Choose a project folder** (e.g. `django_blog`, `api_project`, etc.)

3. **Set up a virtual environment**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate     # On Unix/MacOS
   # or
   venv\Scripts\activate        # On Windows
   ```

4. **Install dependencies**
   Typically there will be a `requirements.txt` in each project or at root.

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Apply migrations**
